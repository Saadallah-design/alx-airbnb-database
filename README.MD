# About this Project 
- This repo is part is part of the comprehensive ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. 
## Project Learnings
- By doing this task, we the learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

## Learning Objectives
As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower us to:

- Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
- Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
- Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

## Key Highlights and tasks
1. Task 1: Craft a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.
2. Task 2: Apply normalization principles to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
3. Task 3: Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.
4. Task 4: Populate the database with real-world sample data, simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.
