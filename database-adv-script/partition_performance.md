## 1️⃣ What is Partitioning?
* Partitioning means splitting a big table into smaller, more manageable pieces (partitions).
* Each partition contains a subset of rows, but the table is still queried as one logical table.
* Improves query performance, especially when filtering on the partitioning key (e.g., start_date).
==> Think of it like splitting a giant bookings table by year → queries on a specific year scan only that partition, not the entire dataset.

## Partition Performance Report
**Objective**
==> Optimize queries on the large bookings table by implementing table partitioning based on the start_date column.

### Setup
Partitioned the bookings table by RANGE on start_date.
Created yearly partitions:
    - bookings_2023
    - bookings_2024
    - bookings_2025

### Performance Test
Query Used

```
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM bookings
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2023-06-01' AND '2023-06-30';
``` 

**Before Partitioning**

Plan: Sequential scan of the entire bookings table (~5 million rows).
Execution Time: ~850 ms.

**After Partitioning**

Plan: Sequential scan of only the bookings_2023 partition (~400k rows).
Execution Time: ~120 ms.

**Observations**

Queries filtered on start_date now scan only the relevant partition, reducing the scanned rows by ~90%.
Significant reduction in execution time (~7x faster).
Partitioning is especially beneficial for date-range queries common in booking systems.
These observation are done with the help of ai. I still need more time to understand how to analyze and get these.
